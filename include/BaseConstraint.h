//  Class BaseConstraint:
/// Abstract base class for constraints of kinematic fits
/**
 * This class defines the minimal functionality any constraint class must provide. 
 * First of all a constraint should know on with particles (or FitObject) it is applied. 
 * Where as for example a constraint on the total transvese momentum takes into
 * account all particles in the event, an invariant mass constraint usually applies only
 * to a subset of particles. 
 *
 * The particle list is implemented as a vector containing pointers to objects derived 
 * from BaseFitObject and can be either set a whole (setFOList) or enlarged by adding
 * a single BaseFitObject (addToFOList).
 *
 * From the four--momenta of all concerned fit objects the constraint has to be able 
 * to calculate its current value (getValue). Constraints should be formulated such that 
 * a value of zero corresponds to a perfectly fulfilled constraint.
 *
 * In order to find a solution to the constrained minimisation problem, fit algorithms
 * usually need the first order derivatives of the constraint with respect to the fit
 * parameters. Since many constraints can be most easily expressed in terms of E, px, py, pz,
 * the constraints supply their derivatives w.r.t. these parameters. If a FitObject uses
 * a different parametrisation, it is its own task to provide the additional derivatives
 * of  E, px, py, pz w.r.t. the parameters of the FitObject. Thus it is easily possible
 * to use FitObjects with different kinds of parametrisations under the same constraint.
 * Some fit algorithms also need the second derivatives of the constraint, 
 * i.e. the NewtonFitter. 
 *
 * First and second order derivatives of each constraint can be added directly to the 
 * global covariance matrix containing the derivatives of all constraints w.r.t. to all
 * parameters (add1stDerivativesToMatrix, add2ndDerivativesToMatrix). This requires the
 * constraint to know its position in the overall list of constraints (globalNum).
